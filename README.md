🎉 Welcome to the UI/UX Project! 🎉
Hey there! This is a fun and modern web app I’ve built to showcase a sleek frontend with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, powered by a Flask (Python) backend. It’s got user logins, a cool contact form, a portfolio showcase, and even an admin dashboard to manage submissions. I designed it to be responsive and easy to use—hope you love exploring it as much as I loved creating it! 😄
📋 What’s Inside?

User Login/Registration: Secure sign-ups and logins with password protection.
Contact Form: Send messages with built-in validation (no spam here!).
Portfolio Page: Check out some awesome project examples.
Admin Dashboard: Peek at all the contact submissions (log in to see!).
Responsive Design: Looks great on phones, tablets, or desktops!
API Fun: A little endpoint to grab project info.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Jinja for dynamic magic.
Backend: Flask (Python) with SQLite for storing everything.
Extras: Smooth scrolling, form checks, and cool CSS animations.
